## Installation

In the command line, run the command `dotnet run` to start the application.

## Usage

This application allows a user to automatically generate employee badges with the following information:

* First/last name
* Employee ID
* Photo
* Company Name

The user can either randomly generate 10 employee badges with information gathered from an API, or can enter their employees' information directly into the command line.

In the `data/` folder that is generated in the root of the application, the user will find all of their generated employee badges, as well as a `.csv  ` file with all of their employees' data.
